# What is this project?
As you know, [Alla](https://alaatv.com/) doesn't have a good video player for viewing lessons. So I decided to make a simple video player to view alaa lessons with it. Hope you enjoy it :)

## No longer public...
2 days after starting this project (in a beatiful rainy day), I decided to make this project more complex and unfortunatly this project is no longer open-source. Maybe in the future, I will make this project public again. Thanks.
